                        server hosting the e-commerce website. Data pertaining to the order will be relayed to a
                        central computer known as the order manager. It will then be forwarded to databases that
                        manage inventory levels; a merchant system that manages payment information, using applications
                        such as PayPal; and a bank computer. Finally, it will circle back to the order manager.
                        This is to make sure that store inventory and customer funds are sufficient for the order to be processed.</p>
